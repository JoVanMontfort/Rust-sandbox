🚀 Rust Tutorial: OOP Without Inheritance — Traits & Composition Explained

💡 Introduction

If you come from Java, C++, or Python, you’re probably used to class inheritance — one class extending another to reuse code or behavior.

But Rust takes a different route.
Instead of saying “A Dog is an Animal” through inheritance, Rust says “A Dog behaves like an Animal” using traits.

This shift makes Rust’s approach both safer and more flexible, avoiding the runtime pitfalls of shared mutable state.
